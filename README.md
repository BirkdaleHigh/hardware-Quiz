### 0. Read a button

First of lets see what kind of input a button can give. There is example code in the  [\[Buttons folder\]](buttons/buttons.ino)

The gist being; 
 
* Setup the inputs
* Setup the outputs (in this case the serail connection to tell us what the board is reading)
* read the button

### 1. Read 4 buttons

Now read 4 buttons and print something different depending on the button pressed. An example can be found in [template4buttons folder\]](template4buttons/template4buttons.ino)
